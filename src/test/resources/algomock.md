URLify: Write a method that replace all spaces in a string with `%20`.
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters,
and that you're given the "true" length of the string.

Note: if you're implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.

Example
Input: "Mr John Smith    "
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
